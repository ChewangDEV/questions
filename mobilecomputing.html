        <h3>Write the application of mobile computing?</h3>
        <p class="ans">
            Mobile computing is used in various fields due to its portability and convenience. It facilitates communication through voice calls, video conferencing, emails, and instant messaging. It provides easy access to the internet, allowing browsing and cloud services like Google Drive. Mobile banking and payment apps enable secure financial transactions. GPS-based services assist with navigation, ride-sharing, and food delivery. Mobile computing is also utilized in healthcare for telemedicine and fitness tracking, as well as in e-commerce for online shopping. Additionally, it supports remote data collection in fields like sales, delivery, and surveys.

        <h3>What are the limitation of mobile computing?</h3>
        <p class="ans">
            Mobile computing, while offering great convenience, has several limitations. One of the major challenges is battery life, as constant use of mobile apps and services drains the battery quickly. Limited processing power compared to desktop computers can affect the performance of resource-intensive tasks. Connectivity issues like poor network coverage or unreliable Wi-Fi can hinder smooth data transmission and access. Security concerns also arise due to the risks of data breaches, hacking, and unauthorized access, as mobile devices are more vulnerable to attacks. Lastly, small screen size and input limitations (like touchscreens) can make complex tasks harder to perform compared to larger devices like laptops or desktops.

        <h3>Define mobile computing. Write the differnece between web browser and WAP browser.</h3>
        <p class="ans">
            Mobile computing refers to the ability to use computing devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or laptops, while being mobile or on the move. It involves wireless communication, portable hardware, and software that enables users to access data and perform computing tasks without being tied to a fixed physical location.<br>

        <h3>Explain prolog statements which is used in WML</h3>
        <p class="ans">
            In WML (Wireless Markup Language), the prolog is a required section at the beginning of a WML document. It provides important information to the WAP browser about the document type and character encoding.<br/>
            Here are the key Prolog statements used in WML:
            <ol>
                <li>XML declaration:<br/>
                        &lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt
                    <ul>
                        <li>Declares that the document is an XML document.
                        </li>
                        <li>Specifies the version of XML being used (typically 1.0).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>DOCTYPE Declaration:<br/>

                        <li>Declares the Document Type Definition (DTD) used for WML.</li>
                        <li>Tells the browser to use the WML 1.1 standard.</li>
                        <li>Ensures the document is valid according to WML rules.</li>
                    </ul>
